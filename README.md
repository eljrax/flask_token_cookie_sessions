# Flask session handler

This repository contains a small example application of a Flask session handler
capable of simultaneously maintaining sessions identified by both cookies as well as an HTTP
header (such as `X-Auth-Token`).

Please see [this blog post](http://northernmost.org/blog/flask-cookie-and-token-sessions-simultaneously/) for further information.
